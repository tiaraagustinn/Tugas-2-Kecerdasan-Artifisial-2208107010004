# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains code for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Dataset

The dataset used is [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz), which contains 60,000 images across 10 classes. The classes are as follows:

- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

The dataset is divided into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is a type of deep learning model highly effective for image classification tasks. CNNs can automatically and adaptively learn important features from images through the training process. In this project, CNN is used to learn features from CIFAR-10 images and classify them into one of the 10 categories.

## Installation
